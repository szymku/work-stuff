inverted index - structure that is design to very fast full-text search [https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/inverted-index.html]
  - terms or tokens (single words) 
  - root word (dog, dogs) root is dog
  - Remember, a preceding + means that the word must be present. (+brown +dog)

both the indexed text and the query string must be normalized into the same form
