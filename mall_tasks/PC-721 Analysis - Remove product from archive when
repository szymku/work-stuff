PC-721 Analysis - Remove product from archive when it is available again

1. We don't need to create new command. We are checking availability during reindex_archive procces.

2. The idea is to add deleting of available products in current procces 
Current proccess
  -  getting all ids from products_archive index
  -  checking if they are available or not
    -  if they are still unavailable we reindex them 
    -  if they became available we do nothing (here is the place for adding our functionality )

  What to do:
  - create redis queue and push all ids (again available) to it 
  - create consumer (new Class or use existing class with new method) for deleting products from index
  - add consumer to config.neon
  - run consumer
