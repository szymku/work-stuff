PC-411 Implement elastic scroll for reindex archive

msg of error:

Some statistics

Number of products in archive: 341597

How memory usage and time differs when set various window sizes for ES:

size set to 1 mln (no size)
memory_peak: ~681 MB
memory: ~618 MB
search time: ~9 s

size set to 100 thousands
memory_peak: ~397 MB
memory: ~371 MB
search time: ~11 s

size set to 10 thousands
memory_peak: ~117 MB
memory: ~114 MB
search time: ~14 s

size set to 1 thousand
memory_peak: ~103 MB
memory: ~102 MB
search time: ~16 s

*memory - memory usage after getting all ids
*memory_peak - peak_memory usage after getting all ids
*search time - time needed to getting all ids using scroll api


Window size chosen to 10 000 as the most optimal.

Time needed to push all products to redis queue around 10 min.

The idea is to run reindex_archive in time of the lowest load.

the most load around: 19-23
the lowest load around: 00-07
