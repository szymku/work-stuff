The way of improvement.

- concentrate on 1 thing, there is one task to do, do it and go further
(sometimes I check things not strictly connected with particular task and... finally it goes anywhere)

- some tasks with oracle db takes to much time - oracle procedures, jobs (PLSQL and SQL should be improved)

- decrease time for looking information that was ones found (kibana, logstash and generally in system) - prepare more accurate notes(where and how was found, step by step) 

- write things down - don't think "I will remember it"

- chef, consul and infrastructure - how the whole architecture is connected; what depends on what

- be better prepared for standups(say clearly what was done, maybe why not and so on; be more communicative) take some time for preparation(10 minutes before)
